# Wiki Bot User Guide

Welcome to the Wiki Bot! This bot helps you quickly access information from various game wikis directly in your Discord server. Here's how to use it:

## Available Commands

### 1. Get a Wiki Link
Use this command to get a direct link to a wiki page:

```
!w <wiki_key> <search_term>
```

- `<wiki_key>`: A single character representing the game wiki (e.g., '1' for Dark Souls 1, 'e' for Elden Ring)
- `<search_term>`: The item, character, or concept you're looking for

Example:
```
!w e Battle-Hammer
```
This will return a link to the Battle Hammer page from the Elden Ring wiki.

### 2. Get a Wiki Page Summary
Use this command to get a brief summary and link to a wiki page:

```
!wp <wiki_key> <search_term>
```

Example:
```
!wp 1 estus
```
This will return a summary and link for the Estus page from the Dark Souls 1 wiki.

### 3. Inline Wiki Links
You can also get wiki links inline in your messages:

```
The !w <wiki_key> <search_term> is interesting.
```

Example:
```
The !w e Battle-Hammer is a powerful weapon.
```
The bot will replace this with a clickable link in its response.

## Available Wikis

- '1': Dark Souls 1
- '2': Dark Souls 2
- '3': Dark Souls 3
- 'e': Elden Ring

## Tips

- Make sure to use the correct wiki key for the game you're referencing.
- If you don't get the result you expected, try rephrasing your search term.
- The bot searches for exact matches, so be as specific as possible.

Enjoy using the Wiki Bot to enhance your gaming discussions!
